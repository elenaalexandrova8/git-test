    <p>Most content on the web is text-based, so you will find yourself needing to work with <strong>HTML</strong> text elements quite a bit.</p>
    <!--Here is some more info about the subject-->
    <h2>Also</h2>
    <p>In this lesson, we will learn about the <em>text-based</em> elements you are <i>likely</i> to use the most.</p>
    <h3>The important point is</h3>
    <p>Just as in human relationships, HTML parent elements can have many children. Elements at the same level of nesting are considered to be siblings. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>Parent 1</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Child 1</li>
            <li>Child 2</li>
            <li>Child 3</li>
          </ol>
        <li>Parent 2</li>
        <li>Parent 3</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
